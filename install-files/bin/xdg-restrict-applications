# Restrict the set of desktop applications visible to the current user
#
# Usage: xdg-restrict-applications DIRS
#
#    DIRS    A colon-separated list of directories (eg from XDG_DATA_DIRS)
#
# Procedure:
#
# 1. Make clones of each directory, populated with symlinks to the items in the
#    original directory, and remove the links to the applications subdirectories.
#    This leaves just the user's applications directory available
#    ($XDG_DATA_HOME/applications).
#
# 2. Return a new list of directories that contains the cloned directories
#    instead of the originals.
#
# The default value for $XDG_DATA_HOME is $HOME/.local/share
#
# Note: if the user's session application (eg gnome-shell) isn't in their
#       applications directory they won't be able to log in.
